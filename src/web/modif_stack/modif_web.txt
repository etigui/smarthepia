Hello Etienne,

Thanks for sharing the details for the issue which you mentioned.

1. I would like to disable the left sliding effect when the page is loading. Is it possible to do it easily ? (Ref : image N°1 and N°2 attached to the ticket).

Apology for the issue caused as we can also able to see that for fraction of second we can able to see the blank left space until the page load.

We have added this issue to our bug list, we will add this bug fix in our next release.

Please use the below quick fix in assets/css/style.css file.

@media only screen and (max-width: 768px) {
    html body .content.app-content {
        margin-left: 0 !important;
    }
}
2. In responsive mode only, I would like to know if It's possible to disable the navigation on the "main page" when the menu (on the left) is open and add a gray color in the background with an opacity like 0.5 ?  (Ref : image N°3 attached to the ticket).

You can add the opacity in css while menu is open

@media only screen and (max-width: 768px) {
vertical-overlay-menu.menu-open{
    .app-content{
        background: #3f4e67;
        opacity: 0.5;
    }
}
3. In responsive mode only, when the menu (on the left) is open, is it possible to let the user close the menu when he touches somewhere else than just the 3 horizontal bars ?

Apology, but this feature is not available as of now, we will consider this inputs for our future updates.

Hope this will work for you.

Thanks,
